# TextAdventureSample
A sample framework for a text adventure

# Basic Concepts
The functionality is split between several major classes:

# MainForm
does nothing but hand input to GameEngine and display the returned output

# GameEngine
initializes World and handles command processing. Output is given as a string.

# World
contains state of all in-game entities (Rooms, etc.)
